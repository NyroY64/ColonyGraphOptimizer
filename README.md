## **Project Overview**
ColonyGraphOptimizer is inspired by the need to allocate resources among agents (e.g., space colonists) with competing preferences while minimizing conflicts. The system models agents as nodes in a graph, their preferences as ordered relations, and conflicts as edges, aiming to find an optimal resource distribution with minimal jealousy.

---

## **Features**
- **Graph-Based Representation**: Models agents and their relationships as a non-directed graph.  
- **Preference Management**: Incorporates strict preference orders for each agent on available resources.  
- **Conflict Minimization**: Calculates and reduces jealousy costâ€”quantified as the number of dissatisfied agents.  
- **Manual and Automated Allocation**: Supports both user-defined assignments and algorithmic optimization.  
- **Scalable Input/Output**: Handles colony data through text-based input and saves results seamlessly.  
- **Error Handling**: Detects and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## **Installation**
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ColonyGraphOptimizer.git
   cd ColonyGraphOptimizer
   ```
2. **Compile the Code** (if using C++):  
   ```bash
   g++ -o colony_optimizer main.cpp -std=c++17
   ```
3. **Run the Application**:  
   ```bash
   ./colony_optimizer
   ```

---

## **Usage**
### **Input Format**:
- A file with the list of agents, their preferences, and conflicts as a graph structure.  

### **Commands**:
- **Manual Allocation**: Assign resources and compute jealousy cost interactively.  
- **Automated Optimization**: Provide preferences, and the program minimizes the cost automatically.  

### **Example**:
To load data from a file and run the optimizer:  
```bash
./colony_optimizer input.txt
```

---

## **Workflow**
1. **Phase 1: Graph Construction**
   - Manually define the colony's graph structure (agents, resources, preferences).
2. **Phase 2: Cost Calculation**
   - Implement and test jealousy cost calculations for a given resource allocation.
3. **Phase 3: Automation**
   - Develop algorithms to find the optimal allocation with minimal jealousy cost.
4. **Phase 4: File Management**
   - Enable data import/export for scalability and error handling.
